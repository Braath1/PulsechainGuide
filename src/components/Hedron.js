<span className="bold">Step 3: Connect to Hedron smart Contract & Add token to Metamask</span> 1) Click Connect button in Metamask to start to connect to the Hedron smart contract. hedron.pro is a trusted website so it is safe to connect to it. Never connect to a site that you do not trust or know anything about. 2) Click ADD HEDRON TO METAMASK. 3) Click Add token.

</div>
<div className="content warning">
<span className="bold">Understand These Rules Before You Continue:</span> If you want to receive your Hedron, you need to mint the Hedron before the HEX miner is finished. For example if you have started a miner that ends on day 2098, you have to mint your Hedron before the last day of the HEX miner, or on day 2097. Hedron only exists because of the T-shares in a miner. When you unstake a HEX miner the T-shares get destroyed and you get newly minted HEX in return. When there is no T-Shares there is no Hedron.<br /><br />You can mint Hedron as many times as you like, but remember that every time you mint there is a transaction cost. If the value of the minted Hedron is less than the transaction cost, it is better to wait until the Hedron accumulates before you mint more. Only way to get Hedron is to mine HEX or to buy it on the open market.
</div>
<div className="content">
<span className="bold">Step 4: How to Mint Hedron</span> 1) The Hedron token is now added to your Metamask wallet. 2) We have 226.32 B-Shares, this is because we mined 4500 HEX and got 0.226 T-Shares in the example from the HEX article. To get to the B-Shares you just multiply the T-Shares by 1000. 3) Click on MINT to mint Hedron.

</div>
<div className="content warning">
<span className="bold">HEX Stake Instance (HSI):</span> This is optional but you should know about it. When you mine HEX natively in the HEX contract you are locked into the HEX contract for the entire time the HEX is mined. With Hedron`s HEX Stake Instance (HSI), you can tokenize your miner and make it into an NFT. Now you can move it and send it to other addresses. This means that you can sell your HSI stakes or list them at an NFT platform. This is the first financial NFT that pays yield! If you make a HSI you should always mine/stake it for 5555 days because that way you will get the max amount of bonus since longer pays better. Since you can sell it whenever you`d like you might as well maximize the future return.<br /><br /> There is also an oportunity to sell your HSI to the Icosa contract for Icosa tokens which you can sell in the open market on Decentraliced Exchanges (DEX) like PulseX or Uniswap. You can also use Metamask to do swaps (fees are a litle higher). If you do not understand everything it is okay, it takes time to learn and there will be a guide on how to sell your HSI for Icosa tokens and also how to stake Icosa to get even more Hedron and Icosa. Compound Interest!

The amount you can borrow depends on how many B-Shares you hold. You have to pay a monthly interest to be able to borrow. If you do not pay your debts within 90 days, the HSI will sent on an HSI auction where anybody can bid to buy out the HSI. This will be further discussed in the Icosa guide.
